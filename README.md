> The HyperLogLog algorithm can estimate cardinalities well beyond 10^9 with a
> relative accuracy (standard error) of 2% while only using 1.5kb of memory.
> ...
> HyperLogLog takes advantage of the randomized distribution of bits from hashing
> functions in order to estimate how many things you wouldâ€™ve needed to see in
> order to experience a specific phenomenon.

[HyperLogLog on Wikipedia:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperLogLog)

> HyperLogLog is an algorithm for the count-distinct problem, approximating the
> number of distinct elements in a multiset

[count-distinct problem on Wikipedia:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count-distinct_problem)

> count-distinct problem (also known in applied mathematics as the cardinality
> estimation problem) is the problem of finding the number of distinct elements
> in a data stream with repeated elements.
